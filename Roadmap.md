## Road map 
### Phase 1: Setup & Architecture Planning üèóÔ∏è
*  Define project structure, select tools, and set up repositories.

__Tasks:__
~~* Set up GitHub/GitLab repository.~~
~~* Define backend architecture _(FastAPI + Spring Boot)_.~~
* Define database schema _(PostgreSQL, MinIO for storage)_.

* Set up Docker for local development.

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Spring Boot & FastAPI) ‚öôÔ∏è
* Start with Spring Boot as the API gateway & user management system.

* Develop FastAPI for dataset processing and ML workflows.

__Tasks:__
* Spring Boot (Java) Development
  * Implement JWT-based authentication _(/auth/register, /auth/login)_.
  * Develop user management APIs _(/users/profile)_.
  * Create dataset metadata storage APIs _(/datasets/upload, /datasets/list)_.
  
  * Implement task orchestration for training jobs _(/tasks/start-training)_.

* FastAPI _(Python)_ Development
  * Set up ML pipeline _(dataset preprocessing, training, evaluation)_.
  * Implement model training APIs _(/ml/train, /ml/evaluate)_.
  
  * Integrate MinIO/AWS S3 storage for dataset handling.

### Phase 3: Database & Storage Setup üóÑÔ∏è
* Implement the PostgreSQL database schema & configure MinIO for object storage.

__Tasks:__
* Write SQL migration scripts _(using Liquibase/Flyway for Spring Boot)_.
* Implement database models for Users, Datasets, Models, Experiments.

* Connect MinIO/AWS S3 for dataset & model storage.

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (React + API Integration) üé®
* Build the React UI, integrating backend APIs for user authentication, dataset uploads, and ML model training.

__Tasks:__
* Set up a React project _(Next.js or Vite for faster performance)_.
* Implement user authentication _(JWT-based login/register UI)_.
* Develop dataset management UI _(upload, view, delete datasets)_.
* Implement ML model training UI _(select dataset, configure model, track progress)_.

* Show real-time training updates using WebSockets or polling.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Scaling üåç
* Deploy backend services on AWS/GCP/Azure, containerized with Docker & Kubernetes.

__Tasks:__
* Deploy Spring Boot & FastAPI backend to a cloud service.
* Set up PostgreSQL & MinIO in the cloud.
* Deploy the React frontend to Vercel/Netlify.

* Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing & deployment.

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization üõ†Ô∏è
* Ensure the system runs smoothly, is scalable, and performs well.

__Tasks:__
* Implement unit & integration tests for APIs.
* Optimize database queries for performance.
* Implement API rate limiting & security best practices.

* Set up monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack).
